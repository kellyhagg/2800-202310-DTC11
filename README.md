# RecallRx

## Overview

RecallRx is an machine learning powered application designed to help users prevent cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia. The app utilizes a machine learning algorithm to offer personalized recommendations and reminders based on the user's daily activities. It also includes monthly dementia screenings in the form of an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) which is the industry
standard tool. These scores are stored and displayed to the user in a graph to track cognitive progress over time, with alerts prompting users to seek medical attention if screening results indicate potential clinical levels of concern.

## Motivation

The purpose of developing RecallRx is to empower individuals to take proactive steps in preserving their cognitive health and delaying the onset of dementia. We recognize the debilitating effects of dementia on daily life and independent functioning, such as memory loss, speech impairment, and difficulties in problem-solving. By conducting thorough research on dementia, we believe that this app can provide users with valuable tools to mitigate their risk and maintain cognitive well-being.

Existing applications on the market often lack the integration of brain training exercises, personalized recommendations, and comprehensive symptom monitoring. Our goal is to create an all-in-one app that combines these features, leveraging our collective knowledge and expertise within the given timeframe to deliver the most beneficial user experience.

## Usage
